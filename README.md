This project is a JSON-based Contacts CRUD API built with Flask to practice RESTful API design, persistence, input validation, and correct HTTP semantics. 
It supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting contacts, stores data persistently in a JSON file, returns proper HTTP status codes, and uses resource-based routes with HTML templates in the backend. An HTML and JavaScript client is included to interact with the API, which was generated by ChatGPT, while all backend logic, validation, and architecture were implemented and verified manually. 
The next project will rebuild the same API using FastAPI to introduce typed schemas and automatic validation.
